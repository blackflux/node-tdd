Drop in replacement for [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) to abstract commonly used test setups


## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save node-tdd

## Usage

Drop-in extension for mocha by simply importing `describe` as below.

<!-- eslint-disable import/no-unresolved, import/no-extraneous-dependencies -->
```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const { describe } = require('node-tdd');

describe('Testing some stuff', /* { ...options }, */ () => {
  it('Testing a thing', () => {
    expect(3 * 7).to.equal(21);
  });
});
```

Please see tests for further usage examples.

### Function Kwargs

#### dir

Type: `string`

The tmp directory for this test. Only available when `useTmpDir` is set.

#### recorder

Type: `object`

Can be called to interact with the currently captured logs. Exposes the following functions:
- `get(level = null)`:  Returns array of recorded logs. Can be restricted by passing in the log level.
- `reset()`: Reset currently captured logs
- `verbose(flag: boolean)`: Set verbosity mode of capture (if the original logger function is called)

 Only available when `recordConsole` is set.

#### capture

Type: `function`

Utility function that takes a function as an argument, calls it and expects it to raise an error. The raised error is returned. If no error is raised an assertion error is thrown instead.

#### fixture

Type: `function`

Utility function that can be used to load test fixtures from the `fixtureFolder`.

Internally this uses [smart-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smart-fs) to determine how a file extension is loaded.

If the fixture is unique, the file extensions is not required.

### CLI Args

#### nock-heal

Used to heal nock recordings. This is useful when the body of (some) recordings is outdated or the recording order is invalid.
Can be used in the following ways:

- `--nock-heal`: Will try to heal ordering of nock cassette recordings
- `--nock-heal body`: Will try to heal bodies of nock cassette recordings (ordering is expected to be correct)

### Options

#### useTmpDir

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When set to true, a fresh temporary directory is set up for each test. The directory is cleaned up after the test run has completed.

#### useNock

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When set to true, all requests are automatically nocked. The recording files are automatically created relative to the current test file.

#### nockFolder

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `$FILENAME__cassettes`

Used to customize the folder name that contains the nock cassettes. This can be useful when multiple describe in
the same file use nock.

#### fixtureFolder

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `$FILENAME__fixtures`

Used to customize the folder name that contains the test fixtures.
Fixtures can be loaded by calling `fixture(FIXTURE_NAME)`.

#### envVarsFile

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `$FILENAME.env.yml`

Used to customize the name of the file that environment variables are loaded from, if it exists.

To allow overwriting of environment variables, prefix the name of the environment variable with `^`.

#### envVars

Type: `object`<br>
Default: -

Used to declare environment variables per describe. Overwrites environment variables
loaded from `envVarsFile` (if allowed).

To allow overwriting of environment variables, prefix the name of the environment variable with `^`.

#### timestamp

Type: `number`<br>
Default: -

Set unix timestamp to freeze time to. Will modify the result of e.g. `new Date()`.

#### record

Type: `object`<br>
Default: -

Expects logger (e.g. `console`) to be passed in and captures input,
which can be accessed by using `recorder` from within the test.

#### cryptoSeed

Type: `string`<br>
Default: -

When set, randomization is overwritten and consistent per test using the provided seed.

#### timeout

Type: `number`<br>
Default: -

Set the timeout for all tests in the suite.
